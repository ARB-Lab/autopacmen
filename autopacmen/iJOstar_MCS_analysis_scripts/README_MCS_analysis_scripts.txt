These are the scripts and results for the MCS analysis of iJO1366 and iJO1366*
described in AutoPACMEN's publication.

"mcs_analysis_run_2019_06_25.m" contains the main MATLAB MCS analysis script,
"compare_mcs.py" is the main Python MCS result analysis script which created
"mcs_analysis.xlsx" where the MCS results are written in spreadsheet form
and with subset and superset information.
