These are the MATLAB scripts of AutoPACMEN's Model Calibrator. Read AutoPACMEN's
manual for more information on them, and/or look at "kcat_optimization_run_fmincon_ec_model_2019_06_25.m"
for an example of the Model Calibrator's kcat optimization method usage.

NOTE: You have to change the paths to the iJO1366*C model (see Supplementary File 1) to its location on your
system in order to rerun "kcat_optimization_run_fmincon_ec_model_2019_06_25.m".

MATLAB scripts starting with "p_" are considered "private" scripts which are not intended for direct
usage by the user and are therefore not documented in the manual.
